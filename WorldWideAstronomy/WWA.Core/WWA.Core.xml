            Notes:
            
            1) The source is presumed to be sufficiently distant that its
            directions seen from the Sun and the observer are essentially
            the same.
            
            2) The deflection is restrained when the angle between the star and
            the center of the Sun is less than a threshold value, falling to
            zero deflection for zero separation.The chosen threshold value
            is within the solar limb for all solar-system applications, and
            is about 5 arcminutes for the case of a terrestrial observer.
            
            3) The arguments p and p1 can be the same array.

            This program is derived from the International Astronomical Union's
            SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.

            The WWA code does not itself constitute software provided by and/or endorsed by SOFA.
            This version is intended to retain identical functionality to the SOFA library, but
            made distinct through different function names (prefixes) and C# language specific
            modifications in code.
